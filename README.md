# Sector-Zero
This repository contains all my writeups, notes, and breakdowns across CTF challenges, binary exploitation labs, reversing exercises, and programming puzzles.
Think of it as my personal garage, where engines get taken apart, binaries get disassembled, and everything gets tuned until it runs.

This repository is a collection of completed (and in-progress) challenge writeups, covering everything from stack smashing to Advent of Code brainteasers.
